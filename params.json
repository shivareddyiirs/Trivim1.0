{"name":"Trivim (Alpha)","tagline":"Source Code","body":"# Trivim (alpha)\r\n===================\r\nThe application can generate 3D street scenarios using a set of 2D images based on the principles of Close Range Photogrammetry. The photos have to be captured with an overlap (minimum being 60%) using consumer grade camera/mobile phone camera along with GPS coordinates of exposure station. Individual floor/residential or commercial unit can be tagged with user defined database. The application comprises of various processes which generates a 3D model that can be imported to a geoportal (Bhuvan, GoogleEarth etc.). Also, Database related query can be performed on the model.\r\n\r\n[Do see this video for further information](http://youtu.be/7DzRpShQniY)\r\n\r\nKey features:\r\n\r\n* One stop solution for generating 3D street views\r\n* On sight Camera Calibration\r\n* Estimation of field time and number of photos\r\n* No on scene GPS point requirement for Geotagging \r\n* Images collected using wide range of cameras/mobile phones can be processed\r\n* Semi automatic segmentation of features\r\n* 3D database creation and simple query options\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n \r\n1.\tAn acknowledgment to Indian Institute of Remote Sensing in the documentation would be appreciated \r\n\t\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Indian Institute of Remote Sensing.
